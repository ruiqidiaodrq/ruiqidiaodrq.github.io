# Ruiqi Diao's Profile

The inspiration for this profile comes from the recently played game Reverse: 1999. The story is set in a world affected by mysterious storms that randomly reverse everything from before 1999, with uncertain consequences. The game focuses on how people from different eras around the world behave and fight for their future to overcome the curse of time reversal. It's an inspiring and captivating game, blending diverse cultures as it weaves its story.

For this profile, I selected some memorable moments from the game, each set in a different location, and used them as backgrounds. As you scroll down, these images change gracefully, giving the feeling of witnessing different eras from around the world. I hope you enjoy the journey! Please note that I do not own these images.
